### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Marco, and I'm a 28-year-old Italian back-end developer. In my day-to-day work, I create microservices exposing _gRPC_ and _REST APIs_ using _Java_ _17_, _Kotlin_, _Spring Boot_ and _Apache Kafka_, embracing an _event-driven_ approach. I also have a foundation in _DevOps_ and _Javascript_. 

> ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning AWS integration (S3, SQS, SES, Lambda) using Spring Cloud AWS 3

If you want to exchange ideas or just have a chat, I'm here! ğŸš€
